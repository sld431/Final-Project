# Final-Project

This code is presented as a video installation. 
The thought behind it is that it is a sort of female empowerment piece.

I chose Maya Angelou's "Still I Rise" poem as the sound that would play while the code runs

I have set up the code so that the words of the poem scroll along the left side of the page.
On the right side of the page images appear according to what words are spoken. 

I used the p5.speech library as a kind of voice recognition to allow the images to correspond to the words spoken. 

The background is red and the text is black.
The text is ideally in 'Futura' font. (Inspired by Barbara Kruger.)
Some of the images I have changed a little bit, either to make them black and white, or to put text on them.
